# The Biggest Card Game: [Play Here](https://datregu-biggest-card.netlify.app/)
This card game is simple: there's 2 players, and each one draws a card. Whoever gets the biggest card wins. This little app was made to simply demostrate the capabilities of the [Deck of Cards API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/)

My focus in this project was the behaviour of the game, testing the posibilites of the card api.

## Optimizations:
The following updates will provide a better UI and more responsiviness by adding media queries.

## Lessons Learned:
A first aproach to api manipulation.
